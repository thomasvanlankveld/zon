## Sunburst

### Anatomy of sunburst

Sunburst diagrams are made from stacked arcs.

### Pie

We probably don't want to use pie, but use arcs directly.

> The pie generator does not produce a shape directly, but instead computes the necessary angles to represent a tabular dataset as a pie or donut chart; these angles can then be passed to an arc generator.
